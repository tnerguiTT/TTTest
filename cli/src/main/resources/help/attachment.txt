SYNOPSIS

   attachment [save|display] --operation=<operation> [--file=<target file>] 
              [--overwrite]

DESCRIPTION

    Display or save the content of the attachments located in the operation 
    response.
    If no --file option is provided, the attachment is saved in the CLI working
    directory, the attachment uuid being used as the file name. 
    If multiple attachments are returned, the attachments are saved using the 
    file name + an index. If --overwrite is present, then any existing file 
    will be overwritten.

OPTIONS

 --operation     - mandatory, the operation that returns attachments.

 --file          - optional, the path of file used to save the attachments.

 --overwrite     - optional, used when saving to a file. Will make the received 
                   file to overwrite existing file.

 --createDirs     - optional, used when saving to a file. Will create the intermediate path
                    to the received file avoiding failure if those directories don't exist.
