SYNOPSIS

    for <variable_name> in <command_line>

DESCRIPTION

    Starts for/done control flow.
    The for statement includes command_line (which is a CLI command
    or an operation) that is executed at the beginning of the for
    control flow. The operation must returns a collection that is iterated.
    The defined variable value is set to the current collection item. The variable
    scope is the for block (terminated by done).

    NB: for can't be used inside a batch, but batch can be used in for blocks.

    Example of a loop that displays the manifest of all deployments:

    for varName in :read-children-names(child-type=deployment)
     echo Manifest file in $varName
     attachment display --operation=/deployment=$varName:read-content(path=META-INF/MANIFEST.MF)
    done
